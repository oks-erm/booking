# Purpose
This project is a CLI app - Restaurant [Booking System](https://my-wicked-booking-sys.herokuapp.com/). The app provides all the essential features, such as creating, editing and viewing reservations. Additionally, it allows the user to log in as a member of staff and holds a database of staff members and customers. It also involves some basic data science to generate statistical reports.

The core purposes of the app:
- optimise the process of booking tables and keeping track of reservations.
- collect and store customers' data for future marketing purposes.
- provide statistical insights into an enterprise's current state.  

The website is built using Python, with little HTML and CSS, as a Milestone Project#3 for the Code Institute's Full Stack Developer course.  

[The live website is available here](https://my-wicked-booking-sys.herokuapp.com/)

# UX Design
## User stories
### As a **business owner**

- I want to manage reservations efficiently.
- I want to keep track of history.
- I want a staff database and the ability to see who added the booking, so in case something about a reservation is unclear, it could be confirmed with a person who added it, without spending time trying to find out who it was.
- I want a customers database for marketing purposes
- I want to receive insights from statistic reports for business decisions.


### As a **first time user**

- I want to understand how to use the app.
- I want to understand where in the program I am and what options are available.
- I want to be able to go to the start menu at any point or go back if I have chosen the wrong option.
- I want to access the contact information of other members of staff.
- I want to easily access customers' information to confirm a booking or make changes.
- I want to find, add, confirm, reschedule and cancel a reservation.
- I want to be reminded of bookings to confirm.


### As a **frequent user**

- I want to be able to navigate fast.
- I want to be sure my account is secured with a password.
- I want to be able to change my password.

## Structure

![](readme/structure.png)

Throughout the app the user is guided with clear instructions and can return one step back or to the start menu at any point.

# Features
## Existing Features

- **Log in**

![](readme/features/auth.png)

Allows the user to log in (by checking a password) or create a new user. The data of existing users is stored in Google Spreadsheets. A member of staff record consists of a name, a password and a contact(phone number) in case there is a need to contact other staff to clarify something about bookings they added.

![](readme/features/new_staff.png)

- **Start Menu**

![](readme/features/start_menu.png)

The Start Menu is an entry point to the program; it allows you to choose between 3 main sections: Bookings, Customers and Staff. At any point in the program further on, the user can go straight back to the Start Menu if they need.

- **Bookings Menu**

![](readme/features/bookings_menu.png)

The Bookings Menu includes options related to bookings: View bookings, Add booking and Edit bookings.

- **View Bookings Menu**

![](readme/features/view_bookings.png)

The View Bookings Menu includes four options for viewing: "Today", "Tomorrow", "a Week", and "All time". Bookings for "Today" are printed in a specific format: with symbols "\/" (if a reservation was confirmed) or "--" (if a reservation needs to be confirmed) and a customer's contact information below to confirm it. Bookings data is obtained from Google Spreadsheet DB.

- **Add Booking**

![](readme/features/add_booking.png)

This section begins with a customer's name request. If the customer doesn't exist, it offers to create a new customer (y/n choice) or try to search for a customer by name again. Having found an existing customer or created a new one, Add Booking function requests a date, time and number of people and writes it to Google Spreadsheets. After a valid date is entered, the program prints out all existing bookings for this date to help the user assess the situation and avoid overbooking. The booking entry has an attribute "created by", so if any doubts or questions regarding a booking arise, it is convenient to contact the person who created it for clarification.

- **Edit Bookings**

![](readme/features/edit_booking.png)

The Edit Bookings Menu offers to Confirm, Reschedule or Cancel a booking. 

- **Confirm**

![](readme/features/confirm.png)

The Confirm function picks all bookings for today that are not confirmed and prints them out, one by one, with a customer's contact information. Having contacted a customer, the user can choose between "Confirmed" (when the reservation is confirmed successfully), "Skip"(when they weren't able to contact the customer) or "Cancel"(when the customer cancelled the reservation on the call).

- **Reschedule**

![](readme/features/reschedule1.png)     
![](readme/features/reschedule2.png)

The Reschedule function allows you to change any parameter of the booking entry: date, time and number of people. When a new date is entered, the program prints out all existing bookings for this date to help the user assess the situation and avoid overbooking.

- **Cancel**

![](readme/features/cancel.png)

The Cancel function cancels a chosen booking. A cancelled booking receives an attribute "cancelled" and remains in the database for analytics purposes.

- **Customers Menu**

![](readme/features/cust_menu.png)

The Customers Menu includes options related to customers: View customers and Stats. A new customer function is not in the menu because there is no need to create a customer without a booking, so it gets created along with a new booking.

- **View Customers**

![](readme/features/view_cust.png)

Allows to search customers by name or view the complete list of existing customers if needed.

- **Stats**

![](readme/features/stats.png)

Generates a pdf report from business's data, such as age groups of customers, number of bookings per customer and percentage of cancelled bookings. It is saved to Google Drive and is avilable by the [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RMQBmiL3ATEkIAtPFmQypM5rcYfzXsD-) below the terminal.

- **Staff Menu**

![](readme/features/staff_menu.png)

The Staff Menu includes options related to customers: View Staff Info and Edit Staff Info.

- **View Staff Info**

![](readme/features/view_staff.png)

Allows to search for staff members by name or view the complete list if needed.

- **Edit Staff Info**

![](readme/features/edit_staff.png)

Allows changing the user's password or a contact phone number to ensure contact information is always up to date.

- **Data Validation**

Date, time, phone, email and number data are validated throughout the app to ensure only correct format valid data is saved to the database.

- **Database**

Google Spreadsheet API is used as a database for the app. There are three worksheets to organise data: "bookings", "customers", and "staff".

- **Web page**

The project requirement was to develop a CLI app, so visual design is not implied. However, I decided to make it a little more eye-pleasing.

## Feature Considerations

### Log of all changes
It would be helpful for business if we could not only see who created a booking but who edited it too.

### Email or SMS reminders

Customers will receive reminders of upcoming bookings via a channel of their choice.

### Birthday greetings

Customers' birthdates are collected to send birthday greetings as well as promo offers for the date. Unfortunately, it was not possible under Heroku limitations. However, could be achieved by setting up [IronMQ](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/iron_mq) service.

## Manual Testing

The app was manually tested in Chrome, Safari and Firefox on MacBook.

### Bugs detected:
#1 - I often have issues with an internet connection. Most of the time, it is handled as an Exception. However, sometimes when the connection gets interrupted during the response from Spreadsheets, which is considered successful, the data is not received: this case does not fall under the exception and the response results in None, which crashes the program. I could replicate it twice.

Solution: raise an Error if a response is None, so it falls under the exception.


## Unit testing

Feature testing was performed through automated unit-testing using [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/contents.html).
To run the tests: install the project's dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`) and use the command `pytest` in the terminal. 
Find the screenshots below:
