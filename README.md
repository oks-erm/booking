The website is built using Python, with little HTML and CSS, as a Milestone Project#3 for the Code Institute's Full Stack Developer course.

The Start Menu is an entry point to the program, it allows to choose between 3 main sections: Bookings, Customers and Staff. At any point of the ptogram further on the user can go straight back to the Start Menu if they need.

The Bookings Menu includes options related to bookings: View bookings, Add booking and Edit bookings.

- **View Bookings Menu**

The View Bookings Menu includes four options of viewing: "Today", "Tomorrow", "a Week" and "All time". Bookings for "Today" are printed in a special format with signs "\/", if a booking was confirmed, and "--", if a booking needs to be confirmed, and a customer's contact below to do so. Bookings data is obtained from Google Spreadsheet db.

- **Add Booking**

This section requests to input a customer's name, if the customer doesn't exist, it offers to create a new customer (y/n choice) or try to search a customer by name again. Having found or created a customer, Add Booking function requests a date, time and a number of people and writes it to Google Spreadcheets. The booking entry also has an attribute "created by", so even if any doubts or questions regarding a booking arise, it is possible to easily contact a person created it for clarification.

- **Edit Bookings**

The Edit Bookings Menu offers to Confirm, Reschedule or Cancel a booking. 

- **Confirm**

The Confirm function picks all bookings for today that are not confirmed and prints them out one by one with a customer's contact information.

- **Reschedule**

The Reschedule function allows to change any aspect of the booking: date, time and number of people.
